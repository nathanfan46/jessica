During our class, we did several personal assessments in order to further explore our personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. 

## Creative Score
My creativity score is 73, which shows I have the above average ability to abstract concepts from ideas. Among the different aspect, the best score I have us the _Curiosity_, it shows I have the desires to change or improve things that everyone else accepts as the norm. 

## MBTI: ENFP
The ENFP personality is a true free spirit. Enthusiastic, creative and sociable, who can always find a reason to smile.
Many other types are likely to find these qualities irresistible, and if they’ve found a cause that sparks their imagination, ENFPs will bring an energy that oftentimes thrusts them into the spotlight, held up by their peers as a leader and a guru – but this isn’t always where independence-loving ENFPs want to be.

ENFPs are fiercely independent, and much more than stability and security, they crave creativity and freedom.

## Creative Attitude Assessment
From my creative attitude assessment, below please see my score in the four different assessment:

Attitude  | Score
-------------- | -------------
CURIOSITY | 26 out of 30
AWARENESS | 23 out of 30
COURAGE | 15 out of 30
PASSION| 26 out of 30
I decided work on courage attitude because it is the lowest grades I have got. And I know I am not brave enough. I’ll choose the “Fear of appearances” challenges to try to show myself more aggressively. For example, take the chance to be the leader of my team. I’ve hesitated to get those chances in the first. I wish I can be more active in the next time.
